            <p class="text-start">HR Acuity LLC (‚Äú HR Acuity ‚Äú) is offering an award-winning web-based SaaS solution that standardizes how employee-related events are investigated, documented, and reported. Providing a disciplined and predictive approach to managing workplace issues, HR Acuity raises the bar in employee relations risk management. This is achieved through the unique HR Acuity On-Demand Application (‚Äù Application ‚Äú).
            Using our Application naturally involves the processing of data. As a matter of principle, HR Acuity applies high standards safeguarding adequate protection of any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‚Äù Personal Data‚Äù). For, HR Acuity is sincerely committed to the security and privacy of Personal Data as well as any other confidential information.

            For that reason, our customers (‚Äù Subscribers ‚Äú) are asked to deploy the Application and HR Acuity‚Äôs related services under an appropriate data processing scheme meeting the requirements of European privacy law, particularly Article 28 GDPR. HR Acuity will not process any personal data within the scope of GDPR on behalf of Subscribers without such data processing arrangements which include explicit instructions on the processing to be undertaken. In consequence, our Subscribers have the benefit of remaining the genuine data controller. We act as data processor on behalf of and subject to the Subscriber‚Äôs directives.</p>

            <h5 class="text-start">Accessibility Statement</h5>
            <h6 class="text-start">Compliance status</h6>
            <p class="text-start">We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability.

            To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium‚Äôs (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.

            This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website‚Äôs UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.

            Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website‚Äôs HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="text-start">2. Privacy Statement</h4>
            <p class="text-start">Our Application may be deployed on a world-wide basis. The data processing takes place on servers that are located within the territory of the United States of America.
            
            While HR Acuity was previously certified under the EU.-U.S Privacy Shield, following the invalidation of this scheme by the Schrems II case, HR Acuity now relies upon Standard Contractual Clauses in order to meet our obligations regarding restricted transfers of Personal Data being subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR . HR Acuity has also undertaken a risk assessment of transfer and can provide further safeguards around the protection of Personal Data through additional contractual clauses if required.</p>
